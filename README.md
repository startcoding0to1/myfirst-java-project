**My First Java Project: Online Shopping App**
## Project Overview
This Java project marks the beginning of my journey into programming. After mastering fundamental Java concepts, including control statements and arrays, at an institute, I embarked on the challenge of building an online shopping app.

Despite the daunting task, only a handful of students, myself included, completed the project within the given timeframe, out of a cohort of 500 to 700 students. Join me on this journey as I share my first steps into Java development with this online shopping app project.

Through this repository, I reflect on the lessons learned, the challenges overcome, and the joy of seeing code come to life. It's more than just a project; it's a testament to perseverance, problem-solving, and the excitement of exploring new horizons in the world of programming.
